             <h3> JavaScript Basics </h3>
            
                <p> JavaScript is a cross-platform,object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely famous for a varity of reasons. It is
                    a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for develeopers to take it in a bunch of different directions. 
                    JavaScript lives inside a host environment(a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments
                    to provide pragmmatic control over them.

                        JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee,
                        a variable holds a value.
                        </li>
                        <li><a href="Variable Assignemnt">Variable Assignemnt</a>
                        Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables- our cup can now have coffee poured in it,
                        giving our variable a value to hold.
                        </li>
                        <li><a href="Data Types">Date Types</a>
                        Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type.
                        There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives:Boolean- true or false; null- null aka nothing; Number - 42 or 3.14159; 
                        String- "Coding Dojo Rocks!"; Array- [1,'Coding',2,'Dojo']; and Object - {first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe' }

                        </li>
                        <li><a href= "Conditionals">Conditionals</a>
                        When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks
                        based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this.
                        There are the following conditional statements: if a specified contion is true, do this code in our code block;else if to specify
                        a new codition to test, if the first condition is false; else we execute this code;

                        </li>
                        <li><a href= "Loops">Loops</a>
                        There are many different kinds of loops in every programming langauge, but they all essentially doo the same thing:
                        they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. That's
                        a loop!
                        </li>
                        <li><a href="Function">Function</a>
                        Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list
                        of instructions. As an example imagine we are puttig together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table
                        top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to
                        do so lets call our function over and over again.
